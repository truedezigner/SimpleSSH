## Agent Workflow Confirmation

When the user replies with a positive confirmation such as "good", "awesome", or "yes":
- Treat it as approval to repeat the same workflow or task sequence that was just completed.
- Before executing that repeated workflow, always ask for a clear Y/N confirmation.

If the user does not explicitly confirm with Y/N, do not run the repeated workflow.
